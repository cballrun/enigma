# Enigma Self-Eval

## Functionality: 3

* Enigma class contains encrypt/decrypt methods and CLI is successfully implemented

## Object Oriented Programming: 4

* Each aspect of the project is split into its own class that does exactly one thing
* Shared code for Encryption and Decryption classes is split into two modules

## Ruby Conventions & Mechanics: 3

* Some methods are over 10 lines long
* Variable and method names are descriptive and logical
* Hashes throughout the project
* Effective use of each_with_index

## Test Driven Development: 3

* SimpleCov at 100%
* Every class builds on the class made before it and requires instantiation of previously-built classes. This allowed class behaviors to be tested at each step of devleopment.
* Above strategy for building allowed edge cases/bugs in previous classes to be addressed as they happened rather than at the end of the project

## Version Control: 4

* Lots of commits with small chunks of code
* Branches for each piece of functionality and secondary branches if refactoring aspects of functionality
* Pull requests upon completion of functionality chunks
